                <li>Because GoBlitz is a community, we rely heavily on all of your support and we welcome you to report any content or activity that you believe may be in violation of our Guidelines at support@GoBlitz.com. We take your reports very seriously, and in most cases, will ask you for information, please understand and follow the following specifications:</li>
                <li>Note that our review decisions may change from time to time, after receiving additional context about a specific broadcast, user account, or user activity, or after seeing new, violating content appearing in a broadcast or on a user account page;</li>
                <li>The number of reports made on any specific content does not affect whether something will be removed. We never remove content simply because it has been reported a number of times; if we do not believe the content to be in violation of our Guidelines, it will not be removed;</li>
                <li>The penalty for violating our Guidelines may vary, in our sole discretion, based on the severity of the violation, and the user’s history on GoBlitz. For example, we reserve the right to issue a warning for a first violation, with continued or more severe violations resulting in a user’s suspension (e.g. temporarily restrict a user’s ability to broadcast, or view or comment on a GoBlitz broadcast) or permanent ban from GoBlitz;</li>
                <li>Not all disagreeable or disturbing content violates our Guidelines. GoBlitz reserves the right to allow sensitive content when it is deemed to be artistic, educational, scientific or newsworthy, so reporting potentially abusive content doesn't guarantee that it will be removed because it may not in fact violate our Guidelines, in our discretion;</li>
                <li>Government authorities may also sometimes ask us to remove content that violates local laws, but does not violate our Guidelines. If we find, after careful legal review, that the content is illegal under local law, then we may choose to make it unavailable in that specific country or territory.</li>
